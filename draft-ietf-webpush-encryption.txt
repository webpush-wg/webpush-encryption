1.  Introduction

   The Web Push protocol [RFC8030] is an intermediated protocol by
   necessity.  Messages from an Application Server are delivered to a
   User Agent via a Push Service.

   This document describes how messages sent using this protocol can be
   secured against inspection, modification and falsification by a Push
   Service.

   Web Push messages are the payload of an HTTP message [RFC7230].
   These messages are encrypted using an encrypted content encoding



Thomson                  Expires January 5, 2018                [Page 2]

   [RFC8188].  This document describes how this content encoding is
   applied and describes a recommended key management scheme.

   For efficiency reasons, multiple users of Web Push often share a
   central agent that aggregates push functionality.  This agent can
   enforce the use of this encryption scheme by applications that use
   push messaging.  An agent that only delivers messages that are
   properly encrypted strongly encourages the end-to-end protection of
   messages.

   A web browser that implements the Web Push API [API] can enforce the
   use of encryption by forwarding only those messages that were
   properly encrypted.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting, when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning described in [RFC2119].

2.  Push Message Encryption Overview

   Encrypting a push message uses elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   [ECDH] on the P-256 curve [FIPS186] to establish a shared secret (see
   Section 3.1) and a symmetric secret for authentication (see
   Section 3.2).

   A User Agent generates an ECDH key pair and authentication secret
   that it associates with each subscription it creates.  The ECDH
   public key and the authentication secret are sent to the Application
   Server with other details of the push subscription.

   When sending a message, an Application Server generates an ECDH key
   pair and a random salt.  The ECDH public key is encoded into the
   "keyid" parameter of the encrypted content coding header, the salt in
   the "salt" parameter of that same header (see Section 2.1 of
   [RFC8188]).  The ECDH key pair can be discarded after encrypting the
   message.

   The content of the push message is encrypted or decrypted using a
   content encryption key and nonce that is derived using all of these
   inputs and the process described in Section 3.

2.1.  Key and Secret Distribution

   The application using the subscription distributes the subscription
   public key and authentication secret to an authorized Application
   Server.  This could be sent along with other subscription information



Thomson                  Expires January 5, 2018                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption                 July 2017


   that is provided by the User Agent, such as the push subscription
   URI.

   An application MUST use an authenticated, confidentiality protected
   communications medium for this purpose.  In addition to the reasons
   described in [RFC8030], this ensures that the authentication secret
   is not revealed to unauthorized entities, which can be used to
   generate push messages that will be accepted by the User Agent.

   Most applications that use push messaging have a pre-existing
   relationship with an Application Server.  Any existing communication
   mechanism that is authenticated and provides confidentiality and
   integrity, such as HTTPS [RFC2818], is sufficient.

3.  Push Message Encryption

   Push message encryption happens in four phases:

   o  A shared secret is derived using elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman
      [ECDH] (Section 3.1).

   o  The shared secret is then combined with the application secret to
      produce the input keying material used in [RFC8188] (Section 3.3).

   o  A content encryption key and nonce are derived using the process
      in [RFC8188].

   o  Encryption or decryption follows according to [RFC8188].

   The key derivation process is summarized in Section 3.4.
   Restrictions on the use of the encrypted content coding are described
   in Section 4.

3.1.  Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement

   For each new subscription that the User Agent generates for an
   Application, it also generates a P-256 [FIPS186] key pair for use in
   elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [ECDH].

   When sending a push message, the Application Server also generates a
   new ECDH key pair on the same P-256 curve.

   The ECDH public key for the Application Server is included as the
   "keyid" parameter in the encrypted content coding header (see
   Section 2.1 of [RFC8188].

   An Application combines its ECDH private key with the public key
   provided by the User Agent using the process described in [ECDH]; on

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption                 July 2017


   receipt of the push message, a User Agent combines its private key
   with the public key provided by the Application Server in the "keyid"
   parameter in the same way.  These operations produce the same value
   for the ECDH shared secret.

3.2.  Push Message Authentication

   To ensure that push messages are correctly authenticated, a symmetric
   authentication secret is added to the information generated by a User
   Agent.  The authentication secret is mixed into the key derivation
   process shown in Section 3.3.

   A User Agent MUST generate and provide a hard to guess sequence of 16
   octets that is used for authentication of push messages.  This SHOULD
   be generated by a cryptographically strong random number generator
   [RFC4086].

3.3.  Combining Shared and Authentication Secrets

   The shared secret produced by ECDH is combined with the
   authentication secret using HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF)
   described in [RFC5869].  This produces the input keying material used
   by [RFC8188].

   The HKDF function uses SHA-256 hash algorithm [FIPS180-4] with the
   following inputs:

   salt:  the authentication secret

   IKM:  the shared secret derived using ECDH

   info:  the concatenation of the ASCII-encoded string "WebPush: info",
      a zero octet, and the User Agent ECDH public key and the
      Application Server ECDH public key, both in the uncompressed point
      form defined in [X9.62]; that is

   key_info = "WebPush: info" || 0x00 || ua_public || as_public

   L: 32 octets (i.e., the output is the length of the underlying
      SHA-256 HMAC function output)

3.4.  Encryption Summary

   This results in a the final content encryption key and nonce
   generation using the following sequence, which is shown here in
   pseudocode with HKDF expanded into separate discrete steps using HMAC
   with SHA-256:

      -- For a User Agent:
      ecdh_secret = ECDH(ua_private, as_public)
      auth_secret = random(16)

      -- For an Application Server:
      ecdh_secret = ECDH(as_private, ua_public)
      auth_secret = <from User Agent>

      -- For both:

      ## Use HKDF to combine the ECDH and authentication secrets
      # HKDF-Extract(salt=auth_secret, IKM=ecdh_secret)
      PRK_key = HMAC-SHA-256(auth_secret, ecdh_secret)
      # HKDF-Expand(PRK_key, key_info, L_key=32)
      key_info = "WebPush: info" || 0x00 || ua_public || as_public
      IKM = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK_cek, key_info || 0x01)

      ## HKDF calculations from RFC 8188
      # HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM)
      salt = random(16)
      PRK = HMAC-SHA-256(salt, IKM)
      # HKDF-Expand(PRK, cek_info, L_cek=16)
      cek_info = "Content-Encoding: aes128gcm" || 0x00
      CEK = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, cek_info || 0x01)[0..15]
      # HKDF-Expand(PRK, nonce_info, L_nonce=12)
      nonce_info = "Content-Encoding: nonce" || 0x00
      NONCE = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, nonce_info || 0x01)[0..11]

   Note that this omits the exclusive OR of the final nonce with the
   record sequence number, since push messages contain only a single
   record (see Section 4) and the sequence number of the first record is
   zero.

4.  Restrictions on Use of "aes128gcm" Content Coding

   An Application Server MUST encrypt a push message with a single
   record.  This allows for a minimal receiver implementation that
   handles a single record.  An application server MUST set the "rs"
   parameter in the "aes128gcm" content coding header to a size that is
   greater than the sum of the lengths of the plaintext, the padding
   delimiter (1 octet), any padding, and the authentication tag (16
   octets).

   A push message MUST include the application server ECDH public key in
   the "keyid" parameter of the encrypted content coding header.  The
   uncompressed point form defined in [X9.62] (that is, a 65 octet
   sequence that starts with a 0x04 octet) forms the entirety of the

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption                 July 2017


   "keyid".  Note that this means that the "keyid" parameter will not be
   valid UTF-8 as recommended in [RFC8188].

   A push service is not required to support more than 4096 octets of
   payload body (see Section 7.2 of [RFC8030]).  Absent header (86
   octets), padding (minimum 2 octets), and expansion for
   AEAD_AES_128_GCM (16 octets), this equates to at most 3992 octets of
   plaintext.

   An Application Server MUST NOT use other content encodings for push
   messages.  In particular, content encodings that compress could
   result in leaking of push message contents.  The Content-Encoding
   header field therefore has exactly one value, which is "aes128gcm".
   Multiple "aes128gcm" values are not permitted.

   A User Agent is not required to support multiple records.  A User
   Agent MAY ignore the "rs" field.  If a record size is unchecked,
   decryption will fail with high probability for all valid cases.  The
   padding delimiter octet MUST be checked, values other than 0x02 MUST
   cause the message to be discarded.

5.  Push Message Encryption Example

   The following example shows a push message being sent to a push
   service.

   POST /push/JzLQ3raZJfFBR0aqvOMsLrt54w4rJUsV HTTP/1.1
   Host: push.example.net
   TTL: 10
   Content-Length: 145
   Content-Encoding: aes128gcm

   This example shows the ASCII encoded string, "When I grow up, I want
   to be a watermelon".  The content body is shown here with line
   wrapping and URL-safe base64url encoding to meet presentation
   constraints.

   The keys used are shown below using the uncompressed form [X9.62]
   encoded using base64url.

6.  IANA Considerations

   [[RFC EDITOR: please remove this section before publication.]] This
   document makes no request of IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8188] describe the limitations of
   the content encoding.  In particular, any HTTP header fields are not
   protected by the content encoding scheme.  A User Agent MUST consider
   HTTP header fields to have come from the Push Service.  An
   application on the User Agent that uses information from header
   fields to alter their processing of a push message is exposed to a
   risk of attack by the Push Service.

   The timing and length of communication cannot be hidden from the Push
   Service.  While an outside observer might see individual messages
   intermixed with each other, the Push Service will see which
   Application Server is talking to which User Agent, and the
   subscription that is used.  Additionally, the length of messages
   could be revealed unless the padding provided by the content encoding
   scheme is used to obscure length.

   The User Agent and Application MUST verify that the public key they
   receive is on the P-256 curve.  Failure to validate a public key can
   allow an attacker to extract a private key.

   Authentication secret (auth_secret):  BTBZMqHH6r4Tts7J_aSIgg

   Note that knowledge of just one of the private keys is necessary.
   The Application Server randomly generates the salt value, whereas
   salt is input to the receiver.

   This produces the following intermediate values:

   The salt, record size of 4096, and application server public key
   produce an 86 octet header of DGv6ra1nlYgDCS1FRnbzlwAAEABBBP4z
   9KsN6nGRTbVYI_c7VJSPQTBtkgcy27ml mlMoZIIgDll6e3vCYLocInmYWAmS6Tlz
   AC8wEqKK6PBru3jl7A8.

   The push message plaintext has the padding delimiter octet (0x02)
   appended to produce V2hlbiBJIGdyb3cgdXAsIEkgd2FudCB0
   byBiZSBhIHdhdGVybWVsb24C.  The plaintext is then encrypted with AES-
   GCM, which emits ciphertext of 8pfeW0KbunFT06SuDKoJH9Ql87S1QUrd
   irN6GcG7sFz1y1sqLgVi1VhjVkHsUoEs bI_0LpXMuGvnzQ.

   The header and cipher text are concatenated and produce the result
   shown in Section 5.
