1.  Introduction

   The Web Push protocol [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol] is an intermediated
   protocol by necessity.  Messages from an Application Server are
   delivered to a User Agent via a Push Service.

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption               August 2016


   Web Push messages are the payload of an HTTP message [RFC7230].
   These messages are encrypted using an encrypted content encoding
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding].  This document describes how
   this content encoding is applied and describes a recommended key
   management scheme.

   For efficiency reasons, multiple users of Web Push often share a
   central agent that aggregates push functionality.  This agent can
   enforce the use of this encryption scheme by applications that use
   push messaging.  An agent that only delivers messages that are
   properly encrypted strongly encourages the end-to-end protection of
   messages.

   A web browser that implements the Web Push API [API] can enforce the
   use of encryption by forwarding only those messages that were
   properly encrypted.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting, when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning described in [RFC2119].

2.  Push Message Encryption Overview

   Encrypting a push message uses elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   [ECDH] to establish a shared secret (see Section 3.1) and a symmetric
   secret for authentication (see Section 3.2).

   A User Agent generates an ECDH key pair and authentication secret
   that it associates with each subscription it creates.  These are sent
   to the Application Server with other details of the push
   subscription.

   When sending a message, an Application Server generates an ECDH key
   pair and a random salt.  The ECDH public key is encoded into the "dh"
   parameter of the Crypto-Key header field; the salt is encoded into
   the "salt" parameter of the Encryption header field.

   The content of the push message is encrypted or decrypted using a
   content encryption key and nonce that is derived using all of these
   inputs and the process described in Section 3.

2.1.  Key and Secret Distribution

   The application using the subscription distributes the subscription
   public key and authentication secret to an authorized Application
   Server.  This could be sent along with other subscription information



Thomson                 Expires February 5, 2017                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption               August 2016


   that is provided by the User Agent, such as the push subscription
   URI.

   An application MUST use an authenticated, confidentiality protected
   communications medium for this purpose.  In addition to the reasons
   described in [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol], this ensures that the
   authentication secret is not revealed to unauthorized entities, which
   can be used to generate push messages that will be accepted by the
   User Agent.

   Most applications that use push messaging have a pre-existing
   relationship with an Application Server.  Any existing communication
   mechanism that is authenticated and provides confidentiality and
   integrity, such as HTTPS [RFC2818], is sufficient.

3.  Push Message Encryption

   Push message encryption happens in four phases:

   o  The input keying material used for deriving the content encryption
      keys used for the push message is derived using elliptic-curve
      Diffie-Hellman [ECDH] (Section 3.1).

   o  This is then combined with the application secret to produce the
      input keying material used in
      [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding] (Section 3.3).

   o  A content encryption key and nonce are derived using the process
      in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding] with an expanded context
      string (Section 3.4).

   o  Encryption or decryption follows according to
      [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding].

   The key derivation process is summarized in Section 3.5.
   Restrictions on the use of the encrypted content coding are described
   in Section 4.

3.1.  Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement

   For each new subscription that the User Agent generates for an
   application, it also generates a P-256 [FIPS186] key pair for use in
   elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [ECDH].

   When sending a push message, the Application Server also generates a
   new ECDH key pair on the same P-256 curve.

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption               August 2016


   The ECDH public key for the Application Server is included in the
   "dh" parameter of the Crypto-Key header field (see Section 6).  The
   uncompressed point form defined in [X9.62] (that is, a 65 octet
   sequence that starts with a 0x04 octet) is encoded using base64url
   [RFC7515] to produce the "dh" parameter value.

   An application combines its ECDH private key with the public key
   provided by the User Agent using the process described in [ECDH]; on
   receipt of the push message, a User Agent combines its private key
   with the public key provided by the Application Server in the "dh"
   parameter in the same way.  These operations produce the same value
   for the ECDH shared secret.

3.2.  Push Message Authentication

   To ensure that push messages are correctly authenticated, a symmetric
   authentication secret is added to the information generated by a User
   Agent.  The authentication secret is mixed into the key derivation
   process described in [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding].

   A User Agent MUST generate and provide a hard to guess sequence of 16
   octets that is used for authentication of push messages.  This SHOULD
   be generated by a cryptographically strong random number generator
   [RFC4086].

3.3.  Combining Shared and Authentication Secrets

   The shared secret produced by ECDH is combined with the
   authentication secret using HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF)
   described in [RFC5869].  This produces the input keying material used
   by [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding].

   The HKDF function uses SHA-256 hash algorithm [FIPS180-4] with the
   following inputs:

   salt:  the authentication secret

   IKM:  the shared secret derived using ECDH

   info:  the ASCII-encoded string "Content-Encoding: auth" with a
      terminal zero octet

   L: 32 octets (i.e., the output is the length of the underlying
      SHA-256 HMAC function output)

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption               August 2016


3.4.  Key Derivation Context

   The derivation of the content encryption key and nonce uses an
   additional context string.

   The context is comprised of a label of "P-256" encoded in ASCII (that
   is, the octet sequence 0x50, 0x2d, 0x32, 0x35, 0x36), a zero-valued
   octet, the length of the User Agent public key (65 octets) encoded as
   a two octet unsigned integer in network byte order, the User Agent
   public key, the length of the Application Server public key (65
   octets), and the Application Server public key.

      context = label || 0x00 ||
                  length(ua_public) || ua_public ||
                  length(as_public) || as_public

3.5.  Encryption Summary

   This results in a the final content encryption key and nonce
   generation using the following sequence, which is shown here in
   pseudocode with HKDF expanded into separate discrete steps using HMAC
   with SHA-256:

      -- For a User Agent:
      ecdh_secret = ECDH(ua_private, as_public)
      auth_secret = random(16)

      -- For an Application Server:
      ecdh_secret = ECDH(as_private, ua_public)
      auth_secret = <from User Agent>

      -- For both:
      auth_info = "Content-Encoding: auth" || 0x00
      PRK_combine = HMAC-SHA-256(auth_secret, ecdh_secret)
      IKM = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK_combine, auth_info || 0x01)
      context = "P-256" || 0x00 ||
                0x00 || 0x41 || ua_public ||
                0x00 || 0x41 || as_public
      salt = random(16)
      PRK = HMAC-SHA-256(salt, IKM)
      cek_info = "Content-Encoding: aesgcm" || 0x00 || context
      CEK = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, cek_info || 0x01)[0..15]
      nonce_info = "Content-Encoding: nonce" || 0x00 || context
      NONCE = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, nonce_info || 0x01)[0..11]

   Note that this omits the exclusive OR of the final nonce with the
   record sequence number, since implementations of this specification

   are not required to support multiple records (see Section 4) and the
   sequence number of the first record is zero.

4.  Restrictions on Use of "aesgcm" Content Coding

   An Application Server MUST encrypt a push message with a single
   record.  This allows for a minimal receiver implementation that
   handles a single record.  If the message is 4096 octets or longer,
   the "rs" parameter MUST be set to a value that is longer than the
   encrypted push message length.

   A push service is not required to support more than 4096 octets of
   payload body (see Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol]), which
   equates to 4077 octets of cleartext, so the "rs" parameter can be
   omitted for messages that fit within this limit.

   An Application Server MUST NOT use other content encodings for push
   messages.  In particular, content encodings that compress could
   result in leaking of push message contents.  The Content-Encoding
   header field therefore has exactly one value, which is "aesgcm".
   Multiple "aesgcm" values are not permitted.

   An Application Server MUST include exactly one entry in the
   Encryption field, and at most one entry having a "dh" parameter in
   the Crypto-Key field.  This allows the "keyid" parameter to be
   omitted from both header fields.

   An Application Server MUST NOT include an "aesgcm" parameter in the
   Encryption header field.

   A User Agent is not required to support multiple records.  Such a
   User Agent MUST check that the record size is large enough to contain
   the entire payload body in a single record.  The "rs" parameter MUST
   NOT be exactly equal to the length of the payload body minus the
   length of the authentication tag (16 octets); that length indicates
   that the message has been truncated.

5.  Push Message Encryption Example

   The following example shows a push message being sent to a push
   service.

   This example shows the ASCII encoded string, "I am the walrus".  The
   content body is shown here encoded in URL-safe base64url for
   presentation reasons only.  Line wrapping of the "dh" parameter is
   added for presentation purposes.

   Since there is no ambiguity about which keys are using used, the
   "keyid" parameter is omitted from both the Encryption and Crypto-Key
   header fields.  The keys shown below use uncompressed points [X9.62]
   encoded using base64url.

      Authentication Secret: R29vIGdvbyBnJyBqb29iIQ
      Receiver:
         private key: 9FWl15_QUQAWDaD3k3l50ZBZQJ4au27F1V4F0uLSD_M

                     T21EEWyf0cQDQcakQMqz4hQKYOQ3il2nNZct4HgAUQU
      Sender:

         public key: <the value of the "dh" parameter>

   The sender's private key used in this example is "nCScek-QpEjmOOlT-
   rQ38nZzvdPlqa00Zy0i6m2OJvY".  Intermediate values for this example
   are included in Appendix A.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the "dh" parameter for the Crypto-Key header
   field in the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Crypto-Key
   Parameters" registry defined in
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding].

   o  Parameter Name: dh

   o  Purpose: The "dh" parameter contains a Diffie-Hellman share which
      is used to derive the input keying material used in "aesgcm"
      content coding.

   o  Reference: this document.

Internet-Draft             Web Push Encryption               August 2016


7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding]
   describe the limitations of the content encoding.  In particular, any
   HTTP header fields are not protected by the content encoding scheme.
   A User Agent MUST consider HTTP header fields to have come from the
   Push Service.  An application on the User Agent that uses information
   from header fields to alter their processing of a push message is
   exposed to a risk of attack by the Push Service.

   The timing and length of communication cannot be hidden from the Push
   Service.  While an outside observer might see individual messages
   intermixed with each other, the Push Service will see what
   Application Server is talking to which User Agent, and the
   subscription that is used.  Additionally, the length of messages
   could be revealed unless the padding provided by the content encoding
   scheme is used to obscure length.

Appendix A.  Intermediate Values for Encryption

   The intermediate values calculated for the example in Section 5 are
   shown here.  The following are inputs to the calculation:

   Plaintext:  SSBhbSB0aGUgd2FscnVz

   Application Server public key (as_public):
      BNoRDbb84JGm8g5Z5CFxurSqsXWJ11ItfXEWYVLE85Y7
      CYkDjXsIEc4aqxYaQ1G8BqkXCJ6DPpDrWtdWj_mugHU

   Application Server private key (as_private):  nCScek-QpEjmOOlT-rQ38nZ
      zvdPlqa00Zy0i6m2OJvY

   User Agent public key (ua_public):  BCEkBjzL8Z3C-oi2Q7oE5t2Np-
      p7osjGLg93qUP0wvqR T21EEWyf0cQDQcakQMqz4hQKYOQ3il2nNZct4HgAUQU

   User Agent private key (ua_private):
      9FWl15_QUQAWDaD3k3l50ZBZQJ4au27F1V4F0uLSD_M

   Salt:  lngarbyKfMoi9Z75xYXmkg

   Authentication secret (auth_secret):  R29vIGdvbyBnJyBqb29iIQ

   Note that knowledge of just one of the private keys is necessary.
   The Application Server randomly generates the salt value, whereas
   salt is input to the receiver.

   This produces the following intermediate values:

   Shared secret (ecdh_secret):  RNjC-
      NVW4BGJbxWPW7G2mowsLeDa53LYKYm4-NOQ6Y

   Input keying material (IKM):  EhpZec37Ptm4IRD5-jtZ0q6r1iK5vYmY1tZwtN8
      fbZY

   Context for content encryption key derivation:
      Q29udGVudC1FbmNvZGluZzogYWVzZ2NtAFAtMjU2AABB BCEkBjzL8Z3C-
      oi2Q7oE5t2Np-p7osjGLg93qUP0wvqR
      T21EEWyf0cQDQcakQMqz4hQKYOQ3il2nNZct4HgAUQUA

      OwmJA417CBHOGqsWGkNRvAapFwiegz6Q61rXVo_5roB1

   Content encryption key (CEK):  AN2-xhvFWeYh5z0fcDu0Ww

   Context for nonce derivation:  Q29udGVudC1FbmNvZGluZzogbm9uY2UAUC0yNT
      YAAEEE ISQGPMvxncL6iLZDugTm3Y2n6nuiyMYuD3epQ_TC-pFP

      BNoRDbb84JGm8g5Z5CFxurSqsXWJ11ItfXEWYVLE85Y7
      CYkDjXsIEc4aqxYaQ1G8BqkXCJ6DPpDrWtdWj_mugHU

   Base nonce:  JY1Okw5rw1Drkg9J

   When the CEK and nonce are used with AES GCM and the padded plaintext
   of AABJIGFtIHRoZSB3YWxydXM, the final ciphertext is
   6nqAQUME8hNqw5J3kl8cpVVJylXKYqZOeseZG8UueKpA, as shown in the
   example.
